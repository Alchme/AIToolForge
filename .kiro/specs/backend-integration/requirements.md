# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the current frontend-only Toolbox application into a full-stack application with a proper backend infrastructure. The current application uses IndexedDB for local storage and client-side AI integration. The new backend will provide user authentication, cloud data synchronization, improved security for API keys, and enhanced scalability while maintaining the free hosting model using GitHub and Vercel.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be synchronized across devices, so that I can access my conversations and custom tools from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a conversation or custom tool THEN the system SHALL store the data in a cloud database
2. WHEN a user logs in from a different device THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display their synchronized data
3. WHEN a user makes changes to their data THEN the system SHALL automatically sync changes across all their active sessions
4. IF the user is offline THEN the system SHALL continue to work with local storage and sync when connection is restored

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure authentication, so that my data is protected and only accessible to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL provide options to sign up or sign in
2. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL create a secure account with email verification
3. WHEN a user signs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate them using secure methods (OAuth or email/password)
4. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL provide access to their personal data only
5. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear their session and require re-authentication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API keys to be stored securely on the server, so that they are not exposed in the client-side code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application makes AI API calls THEN the system SHALL route requests through the backend server
2. WHEN API keys are needed THEN the system SHALL retrieve them from secure server-side environment variables
3. WHEN a user makes an AI request THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user before processing the request
4. IF an unauthorized request is made THEN the system SHALL reject it with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remain fast and responsive, so that my workflow is not interrupted by backend integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to local storage functionality
2. WHEN data is being synced THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states without blocking the UI
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL respond within reasonable time limits (< 5 seconds)
4. WHEN the user performs actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback while processing in the background

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the free hosting model, so that the application remains cost-effective to operate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the backend THEN the system SHALL use free tier services (Vercel Functions, Supabase, etc.)
2. WHEN the application scales THEN the system SHALL remain within free tier limits
3. WHEN choosing technologies THEN the system SHALL prioritize free and open-source solutions
4. IF usage approaches free tier limits THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate rate limiting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my existing data to be preserved during the migration, so that I don't lose my conversations and custom tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new backend is deployed THEN the system SHALL provide a migration path for existing IndexedDB data
2. WHEN a user first signs in THEN the system SHALL offer to import their local data to the cloud
3. WHEN data migration occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve all conversations, custom tools, and settings
4. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL maintain local data integrity and allow retry

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control the privacy of my custom tools, so that I can keep personal tools private or share useful tools with the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a custom tool THEN the system SHALL default to private visibility
2. WHEN a user wants to share a tool THEN the system SHALL provide an option to make it public
3. WHEN a tool is made public THEN the system SHALL display it in a community marketplace for all users
4. WHEN a user views public tools THEN the system SHALL show the original creator's attribution
5. WHEN a user wants to use a public tool THEN the system SHALL allow them to add it to their personal collection
6. WHEN a user changes tool privacy settings THEN the system SHALL immediately update the tool's visibility

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to discover and use tools created by other users, so that I can benefit from the community's creativity and productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browsing the marketplace THEN the system SHALL display both built-in tools and public community tools
2. WHEN viewing community tools THEN the system SHALL show ratings, usage statistics, and creator information
3. WHEN a user finds a useful public tool THEN the system SHALL allow them to add it to their personal toolkit
4. WHEN using a community tool THEN the system SHALL track usage statistics for the original creator
5. IF a community tool is updated by its creator THEN the system SHALL notify users who have added it to their collection

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and monitoring, so that I can maintain and debug the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately for debugging
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users
3. WHEN the system encounters issues THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality
4. WHEN monitoring the application THEN the system SHALL provide insights into usage patterns and performance
