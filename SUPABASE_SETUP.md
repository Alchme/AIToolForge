# ðŸš€ Supabase Setup Complete!

Your Supabase credentials have been configured in `.env.local`. Now you need to set up the database schema.

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Database Schema

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/itykmevgrmspufjklkmf
2. Click on **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy and paste the entire contents of `database/schema.sql` into the SQL editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

This will create all the necessary tables and security policies for your application.

### 1.1. Update Usage Policies (If You Already Have an Existing Database)

If you already have a database set up and need to update the usage tracking policies:

1. In your Supabase SQL Editor, create a **New Query**
2. Copy and paste the contents of `database/update-usage-policies.sql`
3. Click **Run** to update the policies

This enables global usage statistics visible to all users.

### 2. Test Your Setup

After running the SQL schema:

1. Restart your development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser to http://localhost:5173

3. Click the **Sign In** button in the sidebar

4. Try creating a new account - you should be able to:
   - Sign up with email and password
   - Sign in with existing credentials
   - See your profile in the sidebar when logged in

## ðŸ”§ Optional: Enable OAuth Providers

To enable Google and GitHub sign-in:

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Authentication** â†’ **Providers**
2. Enable the providers you want:
   - **Google**: You'll need to create a Google OAuth app and add the client ID/secret
   - **GitHub**: You'll need to create a GitHub OAuth app and add the client ID/secret

## âœ… What's Been Set Up

- âœ… Environment variables configured
- âœ… Database schema ready to deploy
- âœ… Row Level Security policies
- âœ… Automatic user profile creation
- âœ… All authentication features enabled

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Database errors**: Make sure you've run the SQL schema in your Supabase SQL editor
2. **Authentication not working**: Restart your development server after setting up the database
3. **Permission errors**: The SQL script includes all necessary permissions and policies

## ðŸŽ‰ You're All Set!

Once you've run the database schema, your authentication system will be fully functional with:

- Email/password authentication
- User profiles and data persistence
- Secure data access with Row Level Security
- Ready for OAuth providers when you configure them

Happy coding! ðŸš€
